# Welcome

These pages include everything you need to know to build a night-flying model helicopter with an RGB LED light show perfectly timed to music. It has been developed by Malcolm & Hamish Morley and has come from several years of flying, experimenting, coding and competing. We hope you enjoy building and flying one of these amazing machines as much as we have.

Please note that whilst flying model helicopters is a lot of fun, it is also inherently dangerous. If you chose to fly model helicopters at night and only illuminated with RGB LEDs there is a higher level of danger. You should only use this system if the model is flown by an experienced pilot and they are happy to accept full responsibility and liability for its use.
