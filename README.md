### Please note that flying model helicopters is inherently dangerous. If you chose to fly large, powerful, model helicopters at night and only illuminated with RGB LEDs there is a higher level of danger. You should only use this system if you the helicopter is flown by an experienced pilot and they are happy to accept full responsibility and liability for its use.
